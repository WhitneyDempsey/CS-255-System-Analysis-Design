# DriverPass System Analysis & Design Project
Undergraduate System Analysis & Design Project | SNHU

The DriverPass project focused on designing a cloud based driver education management system for a client. The compnay wanted to modernize its services by creating a centralized platform where students could register for training packages, complete online courseworkd, take practice exams aligned with DMV requirements, and schedule behind the wheel driving lessons. The system also needed to support administrative staff, instructors, and the business owner through role based acess, scheduling tools, reporting features, and secure data management. Overall, the goal was to improve student success rates while streamlining business operations through a scalable, web based design. 

## Project Reflection

One area I perfomed particlarly well in was translating the client interview into clear functional & nonfunctional requirements. I carefully outlined what the system shall do and ensured each requirement aligned with the client's stated needs. I also did well structuring the system design document so that the UML diagrams, technical requirements, and security considerations directly supported the original business requirements. This helped maintain consistency between analysis and design. 

If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the UML sequence diagram to make interactions even cleaner and more detailed. While it captures the flow between users and system components. I could improve it by adding more specific system responses & exception handling paths. Enhancing this diagram would make the system interactions easier for developers to interpret during implementation. 

To interpret the user's needs, I focused on identifying both explicit requirements and underlying business goals. For example, the client emphasized improving DMV test success rates, so I incorportated features such as practice tests, lesson tracking, and content updates tied to DMV changes. I also ensured that scheduling flexibility & role based access were central components of the design. Considering user needs is critical in system design because a technically sound system can still fail if it does not solve the real problems of its users. By grouding design decisions in user goals, the system becomes pratical, usable, and aligned with business objectives. 

When approaching software design, I begin by clearly defining the problem and identifying stakeholders. I then break the system into functional components, define requirements, and model behavior using UML diagrams. Techniques such as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams help me visualize system interactions and structure before development begins. In the future, I plan to continue using requirement traceability, iterative refinement, and stakeholder feedback to ensure alignment between analysis & implementation. Designing software is not just about building features, it is about building solutions that meet real user needs in a structured and maintainable way.
